# HOMEWORK---NON_LINEAR-REGRESSION

General Explanation:
Applying Non_Linear Regression Models on a dataset selected from Kaggle (You can use the same dataset that used for Linear regression)
Detailed Explanation:
1- Select a dataset from Kaggle and apply the following models on this dataset.
a) KNN
b) SVR Linear
c) SVR Non_Linear
d) MLP
e) CART
f) BAGGING TREE
g) RANDOM FOREST
h) GBM
i) XGBoostT
j) LightGBM
k) CatBoost
2-Prepare the homework on kaggle. (Please, activate the GPU accelerator on kaggle when you work on dataset and deactivate when you finish working)
3- When choosing dataset, take care that the data set must include categorical data and convert these categorical data into numerical data (you can use get_dummies method).
4- Your dataset should be a dataset suitable for the regression problem. (dependent values can be salary, age, score etc.)
5- If the number of data in the data you selected is high, the results will be more accurate.
6- Interpret the results. Evaluate which model works best for your data.
